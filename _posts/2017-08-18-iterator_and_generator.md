## motivation
In terms of the concepts of iterable,iterator and generator of python, it seems very confusing such that it's difficult to tell the differences clearly between them. Here I give an explanation of this mainly based on my own knowledge.
## an illustration
following figure comes from [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/iterators-vs-generators/).

    <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
